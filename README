NAME
    Devel::Leak::Cb - Detect leaked callbacks

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
        use Devel::Leak::Cb;

    AnyEvent->timer( cb => cb {
        ...
        });

    # If $ENV{DEBUG_CB} is true and callback not destroyed till END, the you'll be noticed

DESCRIPTION
    By default, cb { .. } will be rewritten as sub { .. } using
    Devel::Declare and will give no additional cost at runtime

    When $ENV{DEBUG_CB} will be set, then all cb {} declarations will be
    counted, and if some of them will not be destroyed till the END stage,
    you'll be warned

EXPORT
    Exports a single function: cb {}, which would be rewritten as sub {}
    when $ENV{DEBUG_CB} is not in effect

    If "DEBUG_CB" > 1 and Devel::FindRef is installed, then output will
    include reference tree of leaked callbacks

FUNCTIONS
  cb {}
